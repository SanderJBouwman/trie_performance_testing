# trie performance testing

## Information
### Introduction
This module was used for a project in order to compare the performance of a trie search versus regular search.
This script uses the https://github.com/dwyl/english-words module to generate a list of words (400.000+ words) to search through.
When the HTML file is opened in browser a script will run which will create a random list of words
varying in length from 3 to 20 characters. For each character length 15 words will be added to the list.
The time it takes to find all individual words with the two algorithms will be inserted into a table. The table will also contain
this table can then be downloaded for further analysis.

Press RESET button to reset the table and start over.

## Installation
